This script was born out of my need to constantly change IP addresses at work. I've slowly added more features as time goes on.
This script is designed for Windows 7-10, but I have had success in running it as the Administrator under Windows XP.
This script also runs fully interactive. In the future, I may wish to add non-interactive command-line parameters, but I have not implemented it.
